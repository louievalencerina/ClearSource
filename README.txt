Clear Source Machine Problem
----------------------------------------

-Ran out of time to add front end error handling so the only way to see error handling is through the console
-Used MUI instead of Bootstrap
-You need to run python manage.py runserver in the terminal at path ReservationAPI
-You also need to run npm run dev in the terminal at path frontend (Couldn't figure out how to run both at the same time with the time i had left)
-Used MUI Appbar templates for the toolbar
-Couldn't add pagination in time
